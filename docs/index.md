# Welcome to BrikFoot

Are you a soccer goalkeeper coach? This is the perfect platform for you. You can track your goalkeepers performance easily without worrying about your data not being accessible outside of your house. 

## I'm a Goalkeeper Coach

To get started, you need to contact the developer for them to create a new admin user for you. You can, then, have full access to the app and even create other users for better collaboration.

Please go to the [User Guide](./user_guide.md) in order to get started!

## I'm a Contributor

If you would like to see a feature added or a bug fixed, please create a PR with a good description in the relevant [repository](https://github.com/Amani215/goalkeeper-performance-tracker). Please understand that the app is developed by one person so reviews can be very slow. Thank you for your contribution!

To get started, you can check this [developer guide](./developer_guide.md).
