# User Guide

## I Do Not Have an Account Yet

If you want to create a platform for your own team, please contact the developer and they will create a special admin user for you. Once the Admin user is created, you will be prompted to change your password. 

**Please make sure to note your password somewhere secure as you will not be able to change it later on!**

Do not worry if you get redirected to the login page once you set up your new password. That is what is supposed to happen! Please login again with your newly created password!

### My team has an account but I don't

Please contact your admin(s) in that case. They can create an account for you. The same steps apply after your account is created by your admins.

## I Have An Admin Account

As an admin, you have the possibility to add other admins with you. You can also add normal coaches and assign them to their teams. The password you set up for the new users will not necessarily be the password they will keep using since they will be prompted to change it the first time they log in. So there is no need to worry about it too much :) Just make sure their name is correct!
