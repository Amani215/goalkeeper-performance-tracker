# Developer Guide

*~ This guide is still a work in progress, please be patient. Thank you! ~*

This app is fully containerized so you will need to have **Docker** installed in order to run it and test it locally.

## Contributing to the API

The API is covered by SonarQube. In order for any code to be accepted in production, your new logic has to be covered by tests. You can take inspiration from other tests in order to meet these requirements. 

You will also need a list of environment variables in a `.env` file. 

## Contributing to the UI

The UI is developed using React and Material UI. Please make sure you follow the best practices and stick to the provided theme. We have to keep a good user experience as our main goal when developing user interfaces.
